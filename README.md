# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to collect and filter global weather data to help individuals planning vacations locate their ideal hotel. To achieve this, I used Jupyter Notebook and the citipy module to create a list of cities based on random latitudes and longitudes. Using the OpenWeather API, weather data for each city was retrieved, and is then filtered by the user. The data is cleaned, and then mapped using the Google Places API. Finally, users can pick the ideal city they want to vacation you, and travel itineraries can be created between their chosen destinations.
